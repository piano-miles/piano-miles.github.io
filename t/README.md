# Short Links Directory

## What is this directory?

This directory is for creating a system of short URLs that redirect to longer URLs on my website. In the future, I want to implement some code to take parameters directly at this address (<https://piano-miles.github.io/t?url-code-here>) and redirect to projects rather than having each separate shortened URL as a separate subdirectory (as it is now, i.e., <https://piano-miles.github.io/t/url-code-here>). That'd just make the file structure cleaner.

## What is the format?

URL codes for shortened links are just the initials of the URL path, unless URL codes have duplicate path initials, in which case a different code is used (I know that's kind of confusing, which is why I want to make a table that shows all of the shortened URLs automatically in the future).

### Huh?

For example, the URL for [Wavefunction Simulator](https://piano-miles.github.io/Wavefunction-Simulator) is <https://piano-miles.github.io/t/ws>. The URL for [Terminize](https://piano-miles.github.io/terminize) is <https://piano-miles.github.io/t/t>. The URL for [resources/study/econ-notes](https://piano-miles.github.io/resources/study/econ-notes) is <https://piano-miles.github.io/t/rsen>. Much easier to type, isn't it?
