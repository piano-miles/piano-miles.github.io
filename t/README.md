# Short Links Directory

## What is this directory?

This directory is for creating a system of short URLs that redirect to longer URLs on my website. You can see an automatically-generated table of the current short URLs below.

## What is the format?

URL codes for shortened links are just the initials of the URL path, unless URL codes have duplicate path initials, in which case a number is tacked onto the end.

### Huh?

For example, the URL for [Wavefunction Simulator](https://piano-miles.github.io/Wavefunction-Simulator) is <https://piano-miles.github.io/t?ws>. The URL for [Terminize](https://piano-miles.github.io?terminize) is <https://piano-miles.github.io/t/t>. The URL for [resources/study/econ-notes](https://piano-miles.github.io/resources/study/econ-notes) would be <https://piano-miles.github.io/t?rsen>. If there was another URL like [resources/study/ecology-notes](https://piano-miles.github.io/resources/study/ecology-notes), the shortened URL would be <https://piano-miles.github.io/t?rsen2>, since rsen is already taken. Much easier to type, isn't it?
