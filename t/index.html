            <p>This directory is for creating a system of short URLs that redirect to longer URLs on my website. In the
                future,
                I want to implement some code to take parameters directly at this address (<a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/t?url-code-here">https://piano-miles.github.io/t?url-code-here</a>)
                and
                redirect to projects rather than having each separate shortened URL as a separate subdirectory (as it is
                now,
                i.e., <a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/t/url-code-here">https://piano-miles.github.io/t/url-code-here</a>).
                That&#39;d just make the file structure cleaner.</p>

        <section class="pad">
            <h2 id="what-is-the-format-">What is the format?</h2>
            <p>URL codes for shortened links are just the initials of the URL path, unless URL codes have duplicate path
                initials, in which case a different code is used (I know that&#39;s kind of confusing, which is why I
                want
                to
                make a table that shows all of the shortened URLs automatically in the future).</p>
            <h3 id="huh-">Huh?</h3>
            <p>For example, the URL for <a href="https://piano-miles.github.io/Wavefunction-Simulator">Wavefunction
                    Simulator</a> is <a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/t/ws">https://piano-miles.github.io/t/ws</a>.
                The
                URL for <a href="https://piano-miles.github.io/terminize">Terminize</a> is <a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/t/t">https://piano-miles.github.io/t/t</a>. The URL for <a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/resources/study/econ-notes">resources/study/econ-notes</a> is <a
                    href="https://piano-miles.github.io/t/rsen">https://piano-miles.github.io/t/rsen</a>. Much easier to
                type,
                isn&#39;t it?</p>
